## ðŸš€ Projects

| Project Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [Tails Bot](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Tails-Bot) | My first programming project - a feature-rich Discord bot built with Node.js. This project has been my learning playground for JavaScript and continues to evolve with new features and architectural improvements. Running it on my Raspberry Pi also helped me learn Linux.  |
| [Frog Music](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Frog-Music) | After the discontinuation of popular music bots like Rythm, I created my ideal Discord music bot - streamlined and efficient, without unnecessary features. |
| [Tails SUS](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Tails-SUS) | A fun Discord bot that mimics users through webhooks. While simple in functionality, it's a community favorite in my Discord server. |
