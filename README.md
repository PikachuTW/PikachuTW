# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) (formerly known as NCTU), Taiwan.

## ðŸ’» Technical Skills

- **Expert in:** Javascript (Node.js)
- **Currently Learning:** C (as part of university curriculum)
- **Also Familiar With:** Python, C++
- **Self-Learning:** Rust, Golang

## ðŸ”¨ Main Focus

I primarily work on Node.js projects, where I have the most expertise and hands-on experience.

## ðŸ“š Learning Journey

While focusing on my university studies, I'm also passionate about expanding my programming horizons through self-study of modern languages like Rust and Golang.

## ðŸš€ Projects

- [Tails Bot](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Tails-Bot): My first programming project - a feature-rich Discord bot built with Node.js. This project has been my learning playground for JavaScript and continues to evolve with new features and architectural improvements. Running it on my Raspberry Pi also helped me learn Linux.

- [Frog Music](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Frog-Music): After the discontinuation of popular music bots like Rythm, I created my ideal Discord music bot - streamlined and efficient, without unnecessary features.
  
- [Tails SUS](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Tails-SUS): A fun Discord bot that mimics users through webhooks. While simple in functionality, it's a community favorite in my Discord server.

- [betterE3](https://github.com/PikachuTW/betterE3): A Userscript enhancing the E3 learning platform with improved functionality and user experience.

- [discord-anime-notifier](https://github.com/PikachuTW/discord-anime-notifier): A bot that scrapes and notifies users about the latest anime releases from major streaming platforms.

- [FB-SAO-Random-Frame](https://github.com/PikachuTW/FB-SAO-Random-Frame): An automated Facebook page bot that scrapes and posts random anime images from SAO.

- [Face-Recognition](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Face-Recognition): A simple face recognition system built with Python for a school project.

- [Tails-SUS-in-Go](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Tails-SUS-in-Go): A Golang recreation of my Tails SUS Discord bot, showcasing my journey into Go programming.

- [Discord-AI-Selfbot](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Discord-AI-Selfbot): A Python-based Discord selfbot powered by Bing AI. This project helped me expand my Python skills beyond my usual Node.js comfort zone.

- [my-rustling](https://github.com/PikachuTW/my_rustlings): Currently diving into Rust programming language through [the Rustlings exercise project](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

- [Discord.js-Command-Handler](https://github.com/PikachuTW/Discord.js-Command-Handler): A template framework for Discord.js v14 bots, providing a solid foundation for building Discord bots.
